      <description>Andrea’s Italian is a classic Italian Restaurant with comfortable neighborhood charm and destination-caliber cuisine. Using the best available local ingredients and property-grown organic herbs and vegetables, the daily changing menu features soulful classics of Italy Country, simply and earnestly prepared.
After 20 years of building successful restaurant, Alfonso Carmona has cut quite a wide swath in the culinary landscape. With Andrea’s, he makes his definitive season.
 “I’m not trying to build a new empire here,” says Alfonso.</description>
