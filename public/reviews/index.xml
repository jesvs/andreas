      <description>★★★★★ Aug 8, 2016 by Chuck Sheffield   We spent the wife&#39;s Birthday evening at the new location with the most excellent service possible. The food seems even better than the old location which was always wonderful. It&#39;s larger but hasn&#39;t lost the personality of a special place to go sit, talk and enjoy a nice dinner at a very affordable price. It&#39;s a jewel. Congrat&#39;s.   ★★★★★ Aug 8, 2016 by Omar   Simple delicious!</description>
