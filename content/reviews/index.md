        We spent the wife's Birthday evening at the new location with the most excellent service possible. The food seems even better than the old location which was always wonderful. It's larger but hasn't lost the personality of a special place to go sit, talk and enjoy a nice dinner at a very affordable price. It's a jewel. Congrat's.
